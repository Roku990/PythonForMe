This is a project for a text based calculator. It can take number inputs for each operation.
1 is for adding, 2 is for subtracting, 3 is for multiplying and 4 is for dividing.

--------

The code is very easy to understand. Each operation is used for each number then an input is asked first to choose the function (operation) then the two inputs are entered and saved into two variables num1 and num2, which are the two "to be used" numbers in the operation.

I hope you enjoy my little project and learn a little bit from it!
